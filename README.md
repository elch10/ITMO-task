The train and test data is [here](https://yadi.sk/d/pgTXMnUgHi-ROA)

Notebook with [LDA](LDA.ipynb), [gensim doc2vec](Doc2Vec.ipynb) and [Attention Based Aspect Extraction](ABAE.ipynb)

The trained modeles and results of clustering is accesible on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zqjfVnM9NDCwhXH_eVQRMRqSqve_a9kY?usp=sharing)
